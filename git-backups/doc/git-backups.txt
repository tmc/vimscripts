*git-backups.txt*	Automatic git backups for all files (and viminfo)

SUMMARY                                                          *git-backups*

The git-backups plugin automatically creates backups of your files using git.
It works on both Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows. When you save a 
file, a copy is stored in a git repository, allowing you to access the history
of your edits.

CONFIGURATION                                             *git-backups-config*

                                                 *g:vim_git_backups_directory*
The filesystem path to store backups. >
  let g:vim_git_backups_directory='~/.vim-git-backups'
<

                                                *g:vim_git_backups_ignore_paths*
A list of path patterns to ignore. Any file path matching these patterns will
not be backed up. The matching is done with Vim's =~ operator against the
beginning of the full file path. >
  let g:vim_git_backups_ignore_paths=['/tmp/', '/var/log/']
<

                                                      *g:vim_git_backups_debug*
Enable detailed debug logging to help troubleshoot issues. When enabled:
1. All operations are logged with timestamps
2. Command stdout/stderr is captured and logged
3. Command exit codes are logged
4. All messages are displayed using the |:echom| command and can be reviewed
   with the |:messages| command

To enable debug logging: >
  let g:vim_git_backups_debug=1
<

When troubleshooting issues with paths containing spaces or special characters,
enable debug logging and examine the messages for errors. This will show the
exact commands being run and any error output from those commands.
